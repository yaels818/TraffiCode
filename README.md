# What is TraffiCode? 🚗🎮

TraffiCode is a PC game designed to give players a chance to practice the basic concepts of driving in a smaller, simpler and safer environment, and provide relevant feedback about their performance.

<br>
Some of the things TraffiCode aims to do for you:
<br>
<br>

- Give you a new, less intimidating, top-down perspective about what urban driving looks like 👀
- Help you get better at dividing your attention between the inside of your car and the outside world 🌎
- Encourage you to master safely merging into traffic with random cars and crossing pedestrians getting in your way 🚘 👫
- Challenge you with 10 different levels of increasing difficulty to keep you in driving shape 💪 😉
- Allow you to give up on rules entirely and just smash into things whenever you feel like it!
  <br> (Because traffic jams are exhausting and driving GTA-style is definitely more fun and less paperwork when it's all virtual, so why the heck not?) 😎
- But hopefully, drive you to be a better, safer (smarter!) driver and follow more traffic codes! 🙏 ❤️

Since my machine runs Windows, I was not able to generate a one-click, plug-and-play version for you guys. 
I apologize but in order for you to play, you will have to take the scenic route reserved for those with more technological know-how:
1.	Make sure you have **Python** and **Pygame** installed (```pip install …```)
2.	Clone this repository
