# What is TraffiCode? 🚗🎮

TraffiCode is a driving game designed to help novice drivers gain a different perspective on driving challenges and deal with them better.

Players can practice the basic concepts of driving in a smaller, simpler and safer environment and get relevant feedback about their performance. 

<br>
Some of the things you will find inside the world of TraffiCode:
<br>
<br>

- crossing pedestrians 👫
- oncoming cars 🚘 
- roundabouts ⭕
- parallel parking 🅿️
- good old-fashioned reverse parking ⚓
- surprises ✨😉

The game contains 10 different levels with increasing difficulty to keep things interesting and keep you in driving shape.

Each level the cars and pedestrians will either increase in numbers or in speed, forcing you to adapt and get increasingly better too! <br>
