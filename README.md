# What is TraffiCode? ðŸš—ðŸŽ®

TraffiCode is a driving game designed to give drivers-in-training a smaller, simpler environment to practice - and see things from a different perspective.

The game focuses on basic challenges - like stopping for crossing pedestrians, steering away from oncoming cars, entering and exiting parking lots... and more.


The game contains 10 levels, in each of them the computer's velocity increases while you have to adapt and either get ahead or get out of the way. <br>

--------------------------
Check out the game's [Wiki ðŸ‘‡ðŸ“š](https://github.com/yaels818/TraffiCode/wiki) for more information!

## How to play:

* 

1) If you do not already have **Python** on your machine - download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2) If you do not already have **Pygame** on your machine - open a terminal and type: ``` pip install pygame ```
3) Download the code to your computer, extract, then open and run from ``` main.py ```
4) Keyboard controls: Use *W* to accelerate, *A* for left turn, *D* for right turn, *S* for reverse

* ðŸš©: Your goal is to get the red car to cross the finish line before the green car!
* ðŸ’¡: If you hit an invisible wall, try either turning a bit or turning and reversing before going forward again.
