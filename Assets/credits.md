# Assets Credits List  

All the assets used in this game were marked explicitly in their respective hosting websites as free content for use in personal and educational projects, some even in commercial projects.

Most of them made no demands regarding credits, but I did my best here to keep track of every maker's due credit anyway. 

You can also check out the real places behind each of the scenes in the game.

## Images - Scenes

1) I used the free program [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) to design each scene using the free tileset packs listed. 

2) The border mask for the scenes were made using an online photo editor, [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)
